# Fetch API with generic wrappers and methods
A flexible implementation of the Fetch API for CRUD

This example connects to a lightweight SQL db for UMS. The front end is built on Vue and plain JavaScript (no CLI) - just Vue as a module and a basic instance.

Back end runs on PDO with a procedural approach - no OOP, just functions and a very basic routing implementaion (if you can even call it routing)

#### TODOs: 
- implement Docker
- move the Fetch API functionality to an external file and then re-import
- change the strategy to async / await instead of callbacks
- upgrade to OOP PHP

## Requirements:
- Vue 
- Git 
- mySQL / PDO

## How to use:
Clone to your local server (MAMP/htdocs, www directory)

Check the credentials in connect.php

Run from your local server
